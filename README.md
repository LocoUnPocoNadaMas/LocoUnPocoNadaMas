### Hi there üëã

My name is Patricio

- ü§ì I'm studying Information Systems Engineering at the National Technological University (UTN) in Argentina.
- üå± I'm currently learning Next.js and Azure Functions with Spring Boot, and subjects of my career of course.
- ü§î I'm know about Spring Boot, and some of other tecnologies like: Unity, C#, C, Java, Javascript, Typescript, MongoDB, MySQL, Angular, React, and more.
- üëØ I'm looking: work in web development, preferably Java backend.
- üí¨ Ask me about: nothing, I'm a noob, but I like to learn new tecnologies so tell me what's new!
- üì´ How to reach me: telepathically, or pray for me to look at my phone (joke). Email is great!
- üòÑ Pronouns: what the heck is this? I'm a human or something like that...
- ‚ö° Fun fact: Engineering is easy. Just like riding a bike. Except the bike is on fire. And you're on fire. And everything is on fire. And you're a poor angel in hell.  
  
Some of my projects:
  
## WEB Development 
 
### NEXT.js 
 
To trying the app you can use this credentials:  
user: `user@test.com`  
pass: `password`  
- [Spotify - Tutorial](https://my-spoty.vercel.app/)
- [Party Guest Management - Personal Project (in progress may not currently work)](https://lukinvitaciones.vercel.app/)

### Angular 
 
This was developed for an events and parties company
###### Brief explantion: you go to party, you take photos, you upload photos
- [Personal - upload photos in party](https://locounpoconadamas.github.io/lukipix-frontend/)
###### and you will see the photos on tv at the party
- [Personal - watch photos in party](https://locounpoconadamas.github.io/lukipix-tv-frontend/)  
> These work with a Spring Boot backend inside a Docker container deployed in a free cloud provider (Koyeb), Azure DDBB mysql and Azure S3 for the photos. For now it is free to try.
  
This is a frontend for a hypothetical coffee shop, but it's only the interface actually deployed so you can't good stuff if I don't have a backend working
- [Page - Coffe Store, it need backend deployed to work, i'm working to get a server](https://locounpoconadamas.github.io/barcito-front/)
- [Repo](https://github.com/LocoUnPocoNadaMas/barcito-front)


### Spring Boot 3 - REST API 
 
And this is the backend of the coffe shop.
- [Coffe Store - Personal project Backend (just java code)](https://github.com/LocoUnPocoNadaMas/barcito)  
###### I will add more public projects soon! but for now im poor and I can't pay a server to deploy my backend. If you want to see more projects, please contact me and I will show you my private repositories.
 I'm working on updating my projects to implement my backend in Azure Functions, so I can show you my projects without paying for a server. Or maybe I will refactor my backends to use NEXT.js, I don't know yet.


### Unity 
  
#### 3D Games:
Just works in desktop, not mobile for now, I'm working on it
- [3D Balls tutorial](https://locounpoconadamas.github.io/Unity-for-Web-Developers/)
- [Platformer 3D tutorial](https://locounpoconadamas.github.io/3D-Platformer/)
   
#### 2D Games:
- [Basic 2D RPG Multiplayer tutorial](https://locounpoconadamas.github.io/RPG-Multiplayer2D-PhPUN/)  

##### Game Jam üòç
Game developed in 10 days from may 19 to may 29 [The GameDev.tv Game Jam 2023](https://asesinodspiadado.itch.io/altereality).
It was my first Game Jam!

ü§ó Thanks for wasting your lifetime in watch my profile, I hope you have a good day, and if you don't, I hope you have a good night. Bye! üëã
