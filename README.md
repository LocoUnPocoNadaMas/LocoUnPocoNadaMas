### Hi there 👋

My name is Patricio

- 🤓 I'm studying Information Systems Engineering at the National Technological University (UTN) in Argentina.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Next.js and Azure Functions with Spring Boot, and subjects of my career of course.
- 🤔 I'm know about Spring Boot, and some of other tecnologies like: Unity, C#, C, Java, Javascript, Typescript, MongoDB, MySQL, Angular, React, Rust and more.
- 👯 I'm looking: happiness, preferably everyday.
- 💬 Ask me about: nothing, I'm a noob, but I like to learn new tecnologies so tell me what's new!
- 📫 How to reach me: telepathically, or pray for me to look at my phone (joke). Email is great!
- 😄 Pronouns: what the heck is this? I'm a human or something like that...
- ⚡ Fun fact: Engineering is easy. Just like riding a bike. Except the bike is on fire. And you're on fire. And everything is on fire. And you're a poor angel in hell.  
  
Some of my projects:

An example of CV using pure html, css and js. (The only complex thing is the style selector at the top right).
