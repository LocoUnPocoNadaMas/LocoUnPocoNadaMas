### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Patricio

- ðŸ¤“ I'm studying Information Systems Engineering at the National Technological University (UTN) in Argentina
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Next.js and Azure Functions, and subjects of my career
- ðŸ¤” I'm know about Angular, Spring Boot, Unity, C#, C, Java, Javascript, Typescript, MongoDB, SQL, and more
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking: to collaborate on The 2023 GDTV Game Jam!!!!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: nothing, I'm a noob
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: telepathically, or pray for me to look at my phone, Discord is good too
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: what the heck is this? I'm a human or something like that
- âš¡ Fun fact: Engineering is easy. Just like riding a bike. Except the bike is on fire. And you're on fire. And everything is on fire. And you're a poor angel in hell.

Some of my projects:
### Unity
#### 3D Games:
Just works in desktop, not mobile for now, I'm working on it

- [Spotify Tutorial](https://my-spoty.vercel.app/)
- [Party Guest Management - Personal Project (in progress may not currently work)](https://lukinvitaciones.vercel.app/)

### Angular
This is a frontend framework, so you can't good stuff if I don't have a backend deployed
- [Personal project about Coffe Store - it need backend deployed to work, i'm working to get a server](https://locounpoconadamas.github.io/barcito-front/)
###### Brief explantion: you go to party, you take photos, you upload photos
- [Personal - upload photos in party](https://locounpoconadamas.github.io/lukipix-frontend/)
###### and you will see the photos on tv at the party
- [Personal - watch photos in party](https://locounpoconadamas.github.io/lukipix-tv-frontend/)

### Spring Boot 3 - REST API
- [Coffe Store - Personal project Backend (just java code)](https://github.com/LocoUnPocoNadaMas/barcito)
###### I will add more public projects soon! but for now im poor and I can't pay a server to deploy my backend. If you want to see more projects, please contact me and I will show you my private repositories.
 I'm working on updating my projects to implement my backend in Azure Functions, so I can show you my projects without paying for a server. Or maybe I will refactor my backends to use NEXT.js, I don't know yet.

ðŸ¤— Thanks for wasting your lifetime in watch my profile, I hope you have a good day, and if you don't, I hope you have a good night. Bye! ðŸ‘‹
